# room-db
Room is a persistence library, part of the Android Jetpack. Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. Room is now considered as a better approach for data persistence than SQLiteDatabase.
It makes it easier to work with SQLiteDatabase objects in your app, decreasing the amount of boilerplate code and verifying SQL queries at compile time
